Generate a system discovery script that gathers essential information about a local host, including OS details, kernel version, installed software, hardware specifications, network configuration, and potential vulnerabilities. The script should: Work for both Linux and Windows. Retrieve kernel version and check for known exploits. List installed software and updates. Identify running processes and services. Enumerate network interfaces, open ports, and active connections. Display user privileges and security misconfigurations. Recommend security patches if vulnerabilities are detected. The script should be concise, efficient, and compatible with common terminal environments (Bash for Linux, PowerShell for Windows). Output should be human-readable and formatted for easy analysis.
